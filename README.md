## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 15/20 

## Self-Reflection:
This was a lot of time just staring at my screen writing code and seeing that it did nothing. Could not get the submit botton to do anything. Wanted to change the HTML but ended up thinking that was not what was expected. Tried to get some help from friends but they also could not figure it out or were getting different errors. 

### How long it took me to finish this?

10 hours and it still doesn't work.
